first of all: i'm sorry you have to look at this

second of all:

- to just get the stuff you need, not all the dev stuff, do this:

npm clean-install --omit=dev 

do not just do a regular install - it will add shit loads of dev-only dependencies to node_modules


- add port number by doing 'set PORT=8000' or something

- npm run start
